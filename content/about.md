<!--- 20th ETSF Young Researchers' Meeting -->

Welcome to the 20th ETSF Young Researchers' Meeting (YRM 2024), an annual event organized by the European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility [ETSF](https://www.etsf.eu/). 
This international gathering brings together early-stage researchers, including PhD and postdoctoral researchers, who are actively involved in exploring 
novel theoretical and computational approaches for studying the electronic and optical properties of materials.

## Oral Sessions

The meeting features five engaging oral sessions, providing a platform for in-depth discussions and presentations:

1. **Electronic Structure Methods Development**
   - Explore the latest advancements in developing electronic structure methods.

2. **Optical Properties**
   - Focus on the optical characteristics and behaviors of diverse materials.

3. **Vibrational Properties and Transport**
   - Investigate the vibrational aspects of materials and their transport properties.

4. **Strongly Correlated Systems and Magnetism**
   - Delve into research on materials with strong electronic correlations and magnetic properties.

5. **Machine Learning in Materials Science**
   - Explore the intersection of machine learning and materials science.

Join us for an enriching experience and the opportunity to connect with fellow participants exploring cutting-edge topics in our workshop!
